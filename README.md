# üìä Portfolio Optimization and Risk Management using Machine Learning

## üîé Project Overview

This project applies machine learning approaches to portfolio optimization and risk management. It combines Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) for diversification and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic allocation, providing a modern alternative to classical portfolio theory.

The project demonstrates how data science, statistics, and ML can be applied to solve practical problems in asset management, such as:

* Constructing risk-balanced portfolios.

* Adapting to changing market regimes.

* Simulating allocation policies under different risk constraints.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Features

* Data Pipeline: Automated download, cleaning, and storage of financial time series (stocks, ETFs, crypto).

* Return & Risk Metrics: Computation of daily returns, volatility, covariance matrices, Sharpe ratios.

* Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP):
    *  Asset clustering using hierarchical clustering (correlation distance).

    * Recursive bisection for weight allocation.

    * Outperforms naive equal-weight and classical mean-variance optimization in stability.

* Reinforcement Learning (RL):

    * Custom PortfolioEnv (Gym-style environment).

    * Agent learns dynamic allocation based on returns, risk signals, and transaction costs.

    * Comparison of RL-based strategies vs. HRP.

* Backtesting Framework:

    * Walk-forward testing.

    * Performance metrics: cumulative returns, drawdowns, volatility, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio.

    * Visualization of portfolio weights over time.
